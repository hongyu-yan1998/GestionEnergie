This package and its subpackages define a first incomplete version of the
Household Energy Management project simply meant to provide a starting point
showing what is expected after the step 1 in the project. The goal of this
first step is to program components representing the equipments for the
complete project. The idea is to see these components as if they were the
software embedded in actual equipments to make them "intelligent". 
</p>
<p>
Subpackages contain BCM4Java components representing electrical equipments:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e1.equipments.hairdryer</code>:
  represents the component, interfaces, ports, connector as well as a
  unit test for a hair dryer, an uncontrollable equipment in project
  terms.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e1.equipments.heater</code>: 
  represents the component, interfaces, ports, connector as well as a
  unit test for a thermostated heater, a suspensible equipment in project
  terms.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e1.equipments.hem</code>:
  represents a first draft for the household energy manager to be
  completed and which execution serves as integration test for the
  whole project at this step.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e1.equipments.indoorgarden</code>:
  represents the component, interfaces, ports, connector as well as a
  unit test for a small indoor garden, a planned and suspensible equipment
  in project terms.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e1.equipments.meter</code>:
  represents a first draft for the electric meter to be completed for the
  project.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.utils.phaser</code>:
  implements a simple synchronisation component called a phaser which is
  used to put in place unit and integration tests requiring a correct
  time ordering in actions performed by different components.</li>
<li><code>hem-adapter</code>: this folder contains the Relax NG grammar
  as well as examples of connection descriptors for equipments to be used to
  generate connectors on the file to connect the HEM to the equipments.</li>
</ul>

This package defines the MIL simulation models for the household energy manager
project. The project serves as evaluation in a master level course on software
architectures for cyber-physical control systems. In this course, a methodology
proposes to specify such a system by starting from a stochastic hybrid system
model to produce a modular DEVS simulator using a new implementation of this
simulation software standard in Java. This first simulator implements a
model-in-the-loop (MIL) kind of simulation, which is useful de assess the system
before beginning the architectural design and then its development. Here,
only a partial system is included (the remaining pieces must be specified by
students) and the goal of the MIL simulation is not to assess the complete
system (the control parts of the system are not simulated in the MIL simulation)
but merely to get a simulation of the electric consumption of appliances, the
electric production of generators and the electric circuit with its electric
meter.
</p>

<p><b><i>Modelling the electric consumption in the HEM project</i></b></p>

<p>
The following describes only a partial model of the HEM project that includes
only three appliances (a hair dryer, a heater and an indoor garden) which
electricity consumption will be simulated and measured by an electric meter.
The next figure presents the overall HIOA model that we will progressively
describe just after.
</p>
<img src="../../../../00images/HEM-e2-model.tiff" alt="HEM-e2-model.tiff"/>
<p>
The hair dryer is modelled by its electricity consumption as the
{@code HairDryerElectricity} model. The hair dryer has three functional states:
{@code OFF}, when it is switched off, {@code LOW}, when it is switched on but
at its lower power mode and {@code HIGH}, when it is switched on and at its
higher power. The electricity consumption is represented by the variable
<i>i</i> evolving over time and as such defined as a signal function
<i>i(t)</i>. This simple model proposes that the hair dryer has a constant
consumption in each of its functional mode (<i>e.g.</i>, 0, 3 or 5 amperes).
The model exports this variable <i>i</i> to be used by the electric meter model
to add all of the consumptions of the appliances. The initial state of the
{@code HairDryerElectricity} model is {@code OFF} and its state changes upon
the reception of four imported events: {@code SwitchOnHairDryer},
{@code SwitchOffHairDryer}, {@code SetHigh} and {@code SetLow}. To test this
model, a user model {@code HairDryerUser} is added to emit these events
(hence, this user model exports them).
</p>
<p>
The indoor garden is similar to the hair dryer from the electricity consumption
point of view, as it simply has three states and three consumption levels, which
are navigated through external events. This model illustrates a point that
despite a more complex appliance (suspensions and plans), the electricity model
needs not be complex. The complexity will be in the component that will manage
the suspensions and plans, but not in the simulation <i>per se</i>. Hence,
the {@code IndoorGardenElectricity} model also has three modes: {@code OFF},
{@code LIGHT_OFF} when the indoor garden is on but the light is still off and
the consumption very low and {@code LIGHT_ON} when it is on, its light is on
and its consumption maximal. The electricity consumption is provided by the
exported variable <i>i</i>. The self-describing events that corresponds to the
actions that can be done trigger the state changes in this HIOA, are emitted
here by the {@code IndoorGardenTest} model, which will give a simulation model
testing the correctness of the electricity consumption simulation model.
</p>
<p>
The heater is more complex. It is modelled in three parts: the
{@code HeaterElectricity} model simulating its electricity consumption
exported as the variable <i>i</i> also represented as a signal <i>i(t)</i>,
the {@code HeaterTemperature} model simulating the room temperature to
guide the decision of heating or not heating and the {@code ExternalTemperature}
model simulating the environment as the external temperature around the
house. The {@code HeaterElectricity} model is very similar to the
{@code HairDryerElectricity} model, hence quite self-explanatory.
The {@code HeaterTemperature} model uses differential equations to represent
the evolution of the temperature of the room <i>d</i> over time. In the
state {@code NOT_HEATING}, the room temperature will evolve proportionally
to the difference between the external temperature and the room temperature
with a factor that represents the thermal resistance of the walls. In the
state {@code HEATING}, a second contribution comes from the heater that is
proportional to the difference between the heating plate and the room
temperature with a factor representing the heat diffusion in the room.
The external temperature is a signal <i>e(t)</i> imported by the
{@code HeaterTemperature} model and exported by the {@code ExternalTemperature}
model. As for the hair dryer, a {@code HeaterUser} model is used to test
the other models by emitting the exported events {@code SwitchOnHeater},
{@code SwitchOffHeater}, {@code Heat} and {@code DoNotHeat}, which are
imported by the {@code HeaterElectricity} and {@code HeaterTemperature} models.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the {@code ElectricMeterElectricity} model imports the signals from
the three appliances electricity models, and when importing them it assigns new
internal names to the three signals to distinguish them internally. It computes
and exports a global intensity signal <i>i(t)</i> as the sum of the three
imported ones.
</p>

<p><b><i>From hybrid systems to DEVS simulation models: the hair dryer</i></b></p>

<p>
The next step is to transform the above models into executable DEVS simulation
models, which are implemented in this package. This transformation requires
several implementation decisions, first the type of DEVS models to be used in
each case and then how to implement them. After that, a simulation architecture
describing the models to be used and how to connect them needs to be defined,
after what the simulator can be constructed automatically and run.
</p>
<p>
The hair dryer simulation models appear in the package
{@code fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e2.equipments.hairdryer.mil}.
First, the events used by the models are defined. Using the DEVS simulation
library, events can be of two types: standard events simply emitted and received
by models or schedulable events that can be scheduled for later execution in
models (as well as emitted and received when the are exported). In this case,
we decided to implement the hair dryer events as schedulable ones, hence the
{@code HairDryerUser} model may then be implement as an event scheduling model
(see below). To ease some verifications in the code, a common abstract
superclass {@code AbstractHairDryerEvent} is created and imposed to the
four concrete events {@code SwitchOnHairDryer}, {@code SwitchOffHairDryer},
{@code SetHigh} and {@code SetLow}.
</p>
<p>
Events have two main methods to be implemented. The method {@code hasPriority}
is used to define a priority order over the events that will be used when more
than one event occur at the same time to decide which one will be executed
first. The method {@code executeOn} takes the reference to the simulation model
as parameter and puts in effect the occurrence of the event on that model.
It typically uses methods in the model to change the state of this model.
For example, the event {@code SwitchOnHairDryer} changes the current state
of the {@code HairDryerElectricity} model to the mode {@code LOW}. It also
toggles a boolean in the model saying that a change in the electricity
consumption of the hair dryer just happened. Other events do similar but
adapted modifications on the {@code HairDryerElectricity} model.
</p>
<p>
The {@code HairDryerElectricityModel} is the DEVS equivalent to the
{@code HairDryerElectricity} model. This model imports the four events that
have just been implemented, which are declared with the annotation
{@code ModelExternalEvents}. As it will compute and export a variable
(signal), it must be implemented as a subclass of the {@code AtomicHIOA}
abstract class provided by the library. To represent the three states in which
the hair dryer can be, we define an enum type and use a variable
{@code currentState} to keep track of the current state of the hair dryer.
The different levels of electricity consumption itself are given by constants
in the class. A few methods are implemented to manage the state of the
simulation model. Then, the methods from the DEVS protocol must be implemented.
</p>
<p>
In the DEVS protocol (see the documentation of the library), there are four
main methods to be implemented:
</p>
<ol>
<li>{@code output} is called just before an internal transition to emit
  events towards other simulation models;</li>
<li>{@code timeAdvance} returns the delay until the next internal
  transition;</li>
<li>{@code userDefinedInternalTransition} implements the computation of the
  state changes in the simulation model when an internal transition
  occurs;</li>
<li>{@code userDefinedExternalTransition} implements the computation of the
  state changes in the simulation model when an external transition
  occurs.</li>
</ol>
<p>
As {@code HairDryerElectricityModel} does not export events, its {@code output}
method always return {@code null}. The model does not have its own choice for
the time at which internal transitions occur; in fact, its state changes occur
when the model receives external events. Hence, we decide to implement the
behavior of the model the following way: when an external event is received,
an immediate internal transition will be triggered, otherwise no internal
transition is planned. So, the boolean {@code consumptionHasChanged} will
tell the model when an external transition changing the electricity
consumption has just occurred and then {@code timeAdvance} returns a 0 delay
to the next internal transition otherwise it returns an infinite delay
(therefore postponing the next internal transition indefinitely).
</p>
<p>
The method {@code userDefinedExternalTransition} is called when the model has
just received some external events. The method {@code getStoredEventAndReset}
is used to retrieve all of the just received events. Thanks to the method
{@code executeOn} defined by events, we can simply call this method passing the
reference to the current model as parameter. We have seen that this will
change the state of the model and toggle the boolean
{@code consumptionHasChanged} to trigger an immediate internal transition.
</p>
<p>
The method {@code userDefinedInternalTransition} is called when an internal
transition is being executed. When it is called, the state of the model has
been updated, so the method {@code getCurrentStateTime} returns the current
simulation time when the internal transition occurs. For
{@code HairDryerElectricityModel}, we compute the new value of the signal
{@code currentIntensity} and update the time of the signal. This variable is
exported by the model, and as such is marked by the annotation
{@code ExportedVariable} and initialised as final by an instance of the
class {@code Value}, which role is to cater for the sharing of exported
and imported variables between models.
</p>
<p>
A final point on {@code HairDryerElectricityModel} concerns the initialisation
of the model when the simulation begins. Two methods are defined. One is
inherited from the class {@code AtomicModel}, {@code initialiseState}, and
is used to initialise state variables of all atomic simulation models. The
other is inherited from {@code AtomicHIOA}, {@code initialiseVariables},
is used to initialise variables.
</p>
<p>
The {@code HairDryerUserModel} serves as a test scenario for the
{@code HairDryerElectricityModel}. To show how to use them, it is defined as
an event scheduling mode <i>i.e.,</i> it can schedule events in the future
and its time advance will be governed by the sequence of scheduled event
occurrences.  It also shows how to use random number generators from the
{@code common-math} library to generate delays between event occurrences.
The method {@code initialiseState} randomly generates a delay to the first
event, creates a {@code SwitchOnHairDryer} event and schedule it for future
execution. NOte that in this initialisation method, we must manually
reinitialise the model internal variables {@code nextTimeAdvance} and
{@code timeOfNextEvent} to make sure that they take into account the newly
scheduled event (they have been initialised by the call to the super-method
but before the event was scheduled to create the necessary data structures
in the model). Most of the previously seen methods that implement the DEVS
protocol are predefined in the abstract class {@code AtomicES_Model} to
simply execute the scheduled events and emit them if they are exported.
Here, we redefine the {@code output} method to generate the next event at
the time the current event is emitted towards the
{@code HairDryerElectricityModel}. A method {@code generateNextEvent} is
used to look at the next event to be executed (by peeking the event list)
in order to generate the following event in our test scenario.
</p>
<p>
Before going any further, it is interesting to test whether the hair dryer
models work properly. To perform a kind if "unit" test for the hair dryer,
we must first assemble the above models under a coupled model, here defined
as {@code HairDryerUnitaryCoupledModel}. A coupled model inherits from the
abstract class {@code CoupledModel}. Here, we simply define the concrete class
without adding anything specific. In more complex examples, this class could
define a simulation report to be returned at the end of simulation runs.
With this coupled model, we next define the simulation architecture to
be run in the class {@code RunHairDryerUnitarySimulation}. The architecture
is defined by creating descriptors for the models to be included. The is done
for atomic models first and then the coupled model that will need top describe
how the atomic models connect through exporting and importing events and
variables. Here, no variables are exported/imported, so the coupled model
need only to express the fact that the four exported events of the
{@code HairDryerUserModel} (source) are imported by the
{@code HairDryerElectricityModel} (sink) as the same event (when models
are created by different developers with different events, the connection
can perform event translations to make emitted events understandable by
the importing model).  The architecture is then created with the atomic
and coupled model descriptors, pointing out the URI of the root model
in the three of simulation models. The call to {@code constructSimulator}
interprets the architecture to create the simulator instances, including the
root simulators that is returned as result. The method
{@code doStandAloneSimulation} is then called on the root simulator to execute
a simulation run with the initial and final simulation time given as
parameters.
</p>

<p><b><i>The indoor garden simulation models</i></b></p>

<p>
As the HIOA models, the simulation models for the hair dryer and for the indoor
garden are very similar, as the exploit similar implementation techniques.
The indoor garden simulation models appear in the package
{@code fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e2.equipments.indoorgarden.mil} with
a subpackage {@code events} containing the classes of events for these models.
</p>

<p><b><i>The heater simulation models</i></b></p>

<p>
The package
{@code fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e2.equipments.heater.mil}
includes the simulation  models for the heater. Again, the events used by the
models are first defined.  In this case,
we decided to implement the hair dryer events as schedulable ones, hence the
{@code HairDryerUser} model may then be implement as an event scheduling model
(see below). To ease some verifications in the code, a common interface
{@code HeaterEventI} is created and imposed to the
four concrete events {@code SwitchOnHeater}, {@code SwitchOffHeater},
{@code Heat} and {@code DoNotHeat}. Contrary to the hair dryer, only the
two first events are schedulable, as they represent actions made by the
user. The latter two, {@code Heat} and {@code DoNotHeat}, are not meant to be
emitted by users but rather by a controller that will decide upon the current
temperature of the room and a target temperature set by the user when to start
or stop heating. Hence, these two are simple events that will be emitted when
the controller will decide to. Another interesting point here, the events
{@code Heat} and {@code DoNotHeat} will be imported by both models of the
heater, {@code HeaterElectricityModel} and {@code HeaterTemperatureModel}.
As such, the method {@code executeOn} must take care of the type of model
on which they are executed to perform the right actions on them. Otherwise,
they are similar to the events defined in the hair dryer simulators.
</p>
<p>
The {@code HeaterElectricityModel} is very similar to the
{@code HairDryerElectricityModel}, hence it should be self-explanatory given
the above explanations. The {@code HeaterTemperatureModel} however introduces
some novelty as it is using differential equations. To ease the programming
of such models, the library proposes another abstract class to be inherited:
{@code AtomicHIOAwithDE}. A differential equation is integrated using an
integration step to move forward in time. At each step, we compute the current
derivatives and then use them to compute the current values of the variables
(signals) with the Euler method. Therefore, {@code AtomicHIOAwithDE} introduces
new methods in the DEVS protocol to initialise the derivatives
{@code initialiseDerivatives} and to compute their current values
{@code computeDerivatives}. The latter is called just before calling
{@code userDefinedInternalTransition}, so this method can simply use the
derivatives just computed to update the variables.
</p>
<p>
The {@code HeaterTemperatureModel} also imports the events {@code Heat} and
{@code DoNotHeat}, which change its state and guide the differential equation
to be used at the next steps. Indeed, when such an event is received, the
temperature variable should be updated immediately with the previous
differential equation before changing the state and take over with the new
differential equation. Because this complicates the model, in this example
we have decided not to take this update into account. When an imported event
is received, the state is updated and the next internal transition will simple
update the variables as if the new differential equation was in force since
the last internal transition. This introduces a small computational error at
each state change, but of little interest to us in this example.
</p>
<p>
The {@code HeaterTemperatureModel} imports the variable external temperature
which is exported by the {@code ExternalTemperatureModel} which simulates the
environment. Here, the implementation of this model shows how to perform
simulation scenarios that outputs variable values (or signals). First, as
the variable is continuous in the hybrid systems model, in the simulation
model we must discretise it using an evaluation step similar to the one used
to integrate the above differential equations. Next, we must chose a
mathematical model for the external temperature. We have chosen a periodic
function that makes the temperature evolve from a minimal one to a maximal
one at the middle of the period and then return to the minimal at the end.
The idea is to model the variation of the temperature over a day, beginning
with the lowest temperature usually just before sunrise in the morning. The
method {@code timeAdvance} simply returns the evaluation step as the delay to
the next internal transition, and {@code userDefinedInternalTransition}
updates the temperature value using a cosine wave over the period and the
variation between the minimal and the maximal temperatures.
</p>
<p>
As for the hair dryer, a unitary test can be constructed by defined a coupled
model for the heater and then a unitary simulation architecture to be run.
The only difference with the hair dryer example is that in the heater example,
we have models exporting and importing a variable. So the class
{@code RunHeaterUnitarySimulation} shows how bindings between exported and
imported variable are made and how the coupled model must define another
constructor that take these bindings into account.
</p>

<p><b><i>The electric meter simulation model and the overall simulation</i></b></p>

<p>
The package
{@code fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e2.equipments.meter.mil}
defines the {@code ElectricMeterElectricityModel}. Similar to the
{@code ExternalTemperatureModel}, this model is an equational one
computing the global electricity consumption as the sum of the
appliances consumptions. It first imports the two variables from the
two other electricity models, hence it defines imported variables
marked by the annotation {@code ImportedVariable}. Note that contrary
to exported variables, imported ones are neither final nor initialised.
In fact, when constructing the simulators, they will be set to the reference
on the instance of {@code Value} put in the source (exporting) model.
The variable {@code currentIntensity} is marked as internal, as it is a
signal neither exported nor imported. The idea is that this value will be read
by the embedding component to provide simulated sensor values when the
electric meter will be requested to do so.
</p>
<p>
The overall simulator providing a kind of "integration" test is defined
in the package {@code fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e2}. Again,
a coupled model meant to gather all of the models into one architecture
is defined by the class {@code HEM_CoupledModel}. The architecture itself
is created and instantiated in the class {@code RunHEM_Simulation}. This class
reuses much of what we programmed in the previous unitary test classes,
adding the electric meter atomic model. Interestingly, it shows how we
can bind variables exported by models to variables with a different name
in importing models. For example, the source variable {@code currentIntensity}
in the {@code HairDryerElectricityModel} is bound to the variable
{@code currentHairDryerIntensity} in the {@code ElectricMeterElectricityModel}.

/**
 * The class <code>RunHairDryerUnitarySimulation</code> is the main class used
 * to run simulations on the example models of the hair dryer in isolation.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class shows how to use simulation model descriptors to create the
 * description of a simulation architecture and then create an instance of this
 * architecture by instantiating and connecting the models. Note how models
 * are described by atomic model descriptors and coupled model descriptors and
 * then the connections between coupled models and their submodels as well as
 * exported events to imported ones are described by different maps. In this
 * example, only connections between models within this architecture are
 * necessary, but when creating coupled models, they can also import and export
 * events consumed and produced by their submodels.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The architecture object is the root of this description and it provides
 * the method {@code constructSimulator} that instantiate the models and
 * connect them. This method returns the reference on the simulator attached
 * to the root coupled model in the architecture instance, which is then used
 * to perform simulation runs by calling the method
 * {@code doStandAloneSimulation}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The descriptors and maps can be viewed as kinds of nodes in the abstract
 * syntax tree of an architectural language that does not have a concrete
 * syntax yet.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Invariant</strong></p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * invariant	{@code true}

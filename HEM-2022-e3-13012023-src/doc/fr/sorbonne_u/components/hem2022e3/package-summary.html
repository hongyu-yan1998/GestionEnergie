<p>
This package implements a set of cyber-physical components to be used as a
starting point in the third step of the household energy manager project.
</p>
<p><i>Introducing cyber-physical components</i></p>
<p>
In this new version, the major change is the inclusion of DEVS simulation
models into components, now made cyber-physical components from the
BCM-Cyphy extension to BCM. This extension provides an integration of DEVS
simulators with components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract plug-ins are provided to add to components the simulation
  capability. Three type of cyber-physical components are introduced with
  these plug-ins:
  <ol>
  <li>Application cyber-physical components that hold simulators to enable
    unit and integration tests in a software-in-the-loop simulation mode.</li>  
  <li>Coordinator components that provide a coordination capability based
    on a DEVS coupled model composing submodels.</li>
  <li>Supervisor components that define the simulation architecture connecting
    simulators provided by application and coordinator components; they have
    both the capability to implement the interconnection of simulators
    among components and the capability to initialise, start and supervise
    simulations and simulation campaigns.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>BCM-Cyphy also provides predefined component interfaces, ports and
  connectors used to compose the simulation part of cyber-physical
  components.</li>
<li>Finally, BCM-CyPhy defines descriptors for simulation models attached to
  components, extending the corresponding descriptor defined in the DEVS
  simulation library.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This new version also turns MIL simulation models defined during the step 2
into SIL ones. SIL simulation are essentially executed in (accelerated) real
time, but here we have preserved the possibility to execute them in MIL mode
<i>i.e.</i>, in a logical simulation time. SIL simulator are deployed within
components through BCM-CyPhy simulation plug-ins. Both BCM-CyPhy and the DEVS
library provides means to have the software in components and the simulators
exchange with each other. There are thre main ways implemented currently:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Components can emit events towards the simulation models they hold
  through their simulation plug-in, hence the execution of the program
  can trigger discrete event execution in the simulation, a capability used
  here, for example, to change the electric power consumption of appliances
  when it is switched on by a call to a service in the component.</li>
<li>Simulators can call methods in the component they are associated with,
  hence it becomes possible for a transition in a simulator to make the
  component execute some action. It is used here in user simulators to
  execute user behavioural scenario in a simulated timely manner but
  triggering the execution of a piece of code in the component.</li>
<li>Finally, components can access data in simulators through their simulation
  plug-in. It is used here to implement simulated sensors, like the temperature
  sensor of the thermostated heater, that will retrieve the room temperature
  computed by the simulation to replace a value that would be provided by
  a hardware sensor in a real execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>
New versions of the components are provided, including their simulation plug-ins
and their simulators. Unit tests and an integration test are also provided.
For the test part, we have maintained the capability to perform unit tests of
the software only, in a similar way to what was done in the first step, and
added the possibility to perform unit and integration tests in a SIL simulation
mode.
</p>
<p><i>From MIL to SIL simulation models</i></p>
<p>
Changes had to be made to the simulation models to turn them from MIL to SIL but
also to cater for their integration in the components. The integration of DEVS
simulators into components have one major constraint: HIOA-type models that
can share continuous model variables can be used within each component but
cannot share variables when they reside in different components. We have
considered that sharing continuous model variables cannot be done among
distinct computers in a distributed system, following the reasoning that made
Lynch and her team introduce TIOA to model distributed artefacts. In the
household energy management project, the main model variables sharing appears
among the electricity consumption models of appliances and the electric meter
electricity model that must gather all consumptions into the global consumption.
To maintain this sharing, all electricity models must be put into one component,
here the electric meter component.
</p>
<p>
This first complicates a little bit the implementation of unit versus
integration tests. In unit test for the hair dryer, for example, the electricity
consumption model of the hair dryer must be created within the simulator held
by the hair dryer component, but in the integration test this model will be
included in the electric meter simulator and introduce the need for passing
a flag at component creation time to know the type of execution that will
be performed: normal execution (never done here as it would need the hardware
appliances), integration test in SIL simulation mode, unit test in SIL
simulation mode and, finally, unit test of the software only (with the caveat
that it is very limited as the interaction with the physical world cannot be
tested at all in this case).
</p>
<p><i>Time-triggered tests scenarios</i></p>
<p>
Testing in this new version is more complicated than in previous versions
indeed. To be faithful to interactions between the software and the physical
world, we need to schedule actions in software at the right time in terms of
simulation time. There are two ways do do that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>To program discrete events, schedule them in the simulator and implement
  their execution as calling the code in the component that we want to
  be executed at the corresponding time.</li>  
<li>To adopt a time-triggered approach where actions are scheduled on Java
  thread pools tasks to be executed at some precise time, but then the time
  at which they are scheduled in the Unix epoch time must correspond the most
  precisely possible to the right time in the simulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Choosing between the two ways is not so simple. Programming simulators to
include events triggering software code execution provides the best possible
timely integration between the software actions and the simulation, but it
complicates the simulators. However, it makes it possible to build sophisticated
user models, for example, as we may use the full power of DEVS hybrid simulation
to this end. Scheduling the actions as tasks in Java can be simpler when it
suffices to trigger actions at some predefined time, like turning on and off an
appliance at predefined times.
</p>
<p>
However, in this latter option, planning scenarios directly with delays until
task execution, as required by the scheduling methods of Java thread pools is
not easy to read and easy to synchronise with the simulation time. Hence, we
have chosen to use a third time line expressed in human readable Java
<code>Instant</code>s for the scenarios. But then,  one need to keep in
synchronisation two different time lines: (1) the time line of test scenarios
made of actions at precise instants, expressed here using the Java
<code>Instant</code> class, and the time line of the real time simulation,
governing the execution of events and the computation of continuous variables.
And this must be done based on the and the Unix epoch time line based on the
hardware clock and used for scheduling tasks on thread pools. This is even more
complex as we want to perform lengthy simulations in an accelerated real time.
For example, in the household energy management project, we would like to
simulate one day in a matter of minutes in accelerated real time. So, instants
and simulated times relates to the hardware clock time modulo an acceleration
factor.
</p>
<p>
In this new version, we have used a facility added to BCM-CyPhy: an accelerated
clock that can keep the synchronisation between a Unix epoch time line for
scheduling tasks and the test scenarios time line expressed as
<code>Instant</code>, including an acceleration factor between the two. The
clock is created to start at some fixed Unix epoch time and then keeps the right
relationships between instants and the Unix epoch time after the start time
associated with the start instant. Synchronising with the simulation time line
is done by using in the simulator a start simulated time equal to the start
instant and the same acceleration factor as the clock.
</p>
<p>
We have implemented the test scenarios using this accelerated clock, which
forced us to pass around the URI of the clock and have a clock server component
from which the other components can retrieve the same clock to use it locally
in their own scenarios and implementation (like the implementation of plans
in the indoor garden component which uses the instant time line to implement
the scheduling of the operations to switch on and off the light at the times
specified in its planning).
</p>
<p><i>Controller components</i></p>
<p>
The last important modification in this new version is the addition of a
controller component in the thermostated heater implementation. Following the
architectural precepts put forward by ALASCA, the controller is implemented
in a component kept separated from the thermostated heater component itself.
This way, one could change the controller without touching the base component,
for example. Don't forget also that such a controller could also be the only
software embedded in a heater hardware, hence also justifying to keep it
separate. In the household project, this choice allows to study what is needed
to have a controller component over a baseline component as also suggested in
autonomic architectures.
</p>
<p>
As it is explained in ALASCA, a controller component has sensor and actuator
interfaces, represented by outbound ports connected to inbound ports on the
baseline component. We introduce here the use of BCM data interfaces to
implement the sensor part. In BCM, a data interface is an interface used when
two components want to exchange data only. Hence, data interfaces simply define
a common Java interface for data objects that will be exchanged and standard
methods that will be used to exchange the data. The main interest of data
interfaces is that they provide two mode for transmitting the data: a push
and a pull mode. In pull mode, the requiring component calls the offering one
to get the data while in push mode, it is the offering component that calls the
requiring one to pass it the data. This is implemented by having the data
outbound and inbound ports be connected two ways. In standard interfaces,
outbound ports are connected to inbound port, but not the reverse. In this
thermostated heater, we use the push mode to notify the controller when the
heater is switched on and off, so that the controller activates its temperature
and heating control only when the heater is on. The control is periodic, so
the piece of code that decides whether to heat or not is executed repeatedly
at some predefined period. Each time it is executed, it retrieves the current
room temperature (and for simplicity, the current target temperature) to
compare it with the target with some hysteresis to start or stop heating.

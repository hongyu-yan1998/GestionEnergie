This package implements the cyber-physical components representing a
thermostated heater for the third step of the household energy manager project.
</p>
<p>
The following diagram mixing a UML component diagram with a class diagram of
the SIL simulator for the <code>ThermostatedHeater</code> to expose the software
architecture implemented by the package:
</p>
<img src="../../../../../../00images/Heater.tiff" alt="Heater.tiff"/>
<p>
Focusing first on the SIL simulator of <code>ThermostatedHeater</code>, the
connections among these classes present the importation/exportation
relationships between the simulation models. The
<code>ExternalTemperatureModel</code> exports the variable
<code>externalTemperature</code> that is imported by the
<code>HeaterTemperatureModel</code>. The <code>HeaterStateModel</code>
imports the four events <code>SwitchOn</code>, <code>SwitchOff</code>,
<code>Heat</code> and <code>DoNotHeat</code> which are triggered by the
methods in the component <code>ThermostatedHeater</code> and pass through
the <code>HeaterCoupledModel</code> that transmits them to the
<code>HeaterStateModel</code>. The <code>HeaterStateModel</code> forwards
the events <code>Heat</code> and <code>DoNotHeat</code> to the
<code>HeaterTemperatureModel</code> but also the four events to the
<code>HeaterElectricityModel</code>. In unit tests, the
<code>HeaterElectricityModel</code> is located in the component
<code>ThermostatedHeater</code> simulator, and then the four events are
exported directly between the two models. However, in integration tests,
the <code>HeaterElectricityModel</code> is located in the component
<code>ElectricMeter</code> and then the four events are reexported by
the <code>HeaterCoupledModel</code> to be received by the
<code>HeaterElectricityModel</code> within this component.
</p>
<p>
At the component level, the <code>ThermostatedHeaterUser</code>
is connected to the <code>ThermostatedHeater</code> to switch on the
heater, set its target temperature and then switch it off at the end of
the execution. The <code>ThermostatedHeaterController</code> is also
connected to <code>ThermostatedHeater</code>, once through the component
data interface <code>HeaterSensorDataCI</code> to receive the state data
and to get the temperature data from <code>ThermostatedHeater</code>, and
a second time through <code>HeaterActuatorCI</code> to start and stop heating.
Note that in a SIL simulated unit test, the SIL simulation is directly
managed by a simulation supervisor component, as there is only one component
(<code>ThermostatedHeater</code>) that has a simulator. In integration tests,
as many components have simulators, a coordinator component must be
interposed between the supervisor and the components having simulators.
</p>
<p>
The classes defining the thermostated heater, its simulator and its tools for
unit testing appear in the following subpackages:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e3.equipments.heater</code>:
  components, component interfaces and interfaces to implement the thermostated
  heater.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e3.equipments.heater.connections</code>:
  classes implementing the ports and connectors for the heater components.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e3.equipments.heater.sil</code>: 
  classes defining the SIL simulator and the associated plug-ins.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e3.equipments.heater.sil.events</code>:
  classes defining the events exchanged in the SIL simulator.</li>
<li><code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e3.equipments.heater.test</code>:
  components and deployments for unit testing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some interfaces and classes are imported from the previous steps in the project.

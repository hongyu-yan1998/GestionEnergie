This package contains the software implementing an indoor garden appliance for
the household energy management project. This projects aims at implementing an
intelligent energy management system able to ensure in real time the balance
between the production and the consumption of electricity in an autonomous
house having its own green electricity production units as well as batteries.
</p>
<p>
The indoor garden is a simple plant growing appliance that provides light
for a given duration each day. The appliance is implemented by the component
<code>IndoorGarden</code>. It is assumed to be programmable <i>i.e.</i>, the
times at which the light is switched on and off during the day, can be planned
in advance. It is also assumed to be temporarily deactivated <i>i.e.</i>, the
light will be switched off until a reactivation order is given. The mix of
planning and activation implies a relatively complex state model within which
the appliance navigates through operations implemented as services:
<code>switchOn()</code>, <code>switchOff</code>, <code>switchLightOn()</code>, 
<code>switchLightOff</code>, <code>deactivate()</code> and
<code>reactivate()</code>. The following automata shows the state space and
the transitions triggered by calling these operations:

<p>
The component is defined around its offered interface
<code>IndoorGardenCI</code>, which is implemented both by the connection
elements (ports, connector) in the package
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e3.equipments.indoorgarden.connections</code>.
It is unit tested with components and deployments provide in the package
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e3.equipments.indoorgarden.test</code>.
As a cyber-physical component, the indoor garden needs to be simulated for
testing as "software-in-the-loop" simulations. The simulation models for this
are implemented in the package
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.hem2022e3.equipments.indoorgarden.sil</code>.
